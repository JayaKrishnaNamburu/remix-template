# This file is being used instead of the typical Netlify _redirects file in the root of your application
# Because /* /.netlify/functions/server 200 will cause the Remix dev server to not serve
# pages when running `netlify dev` if it is in the netlify.toml file or a _redirects file.
# The build step will copy this file to the publish directory for your application and rename it to _redirects
# so that it will be used by Netlify when your site is deployed.
# Do not remove. This file is required to serve the site when deployed.

/* /.netlify/functions/server 200

# Add other redirects and rewrites here and/or in your netlify.toml
